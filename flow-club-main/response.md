How did you prioritize your time?  What did you work on?

- In order to complete the requirements, I made sure to tackle the ability for users to add new todo items first. Then decided I would add edit/delete capabilities after.


What decision points did you come to, especially on the technical side?  How did you reach the decision you did?  Are there any questions you would have asked if you could?

- On the technical side, I wanted to be sure that users statuses would be synced in real time. I created some basic dummy data to render to ensure the databse was updating in real time. Once this was known, it was just a matter of creating the todo list and update methods. I have used Firebase in the past but have forgotten a lot of the methods and functions for adding and minipulating data in the db.

I would have added some input validation when adding or editing todo items. I would add confirmation for deleting an item. I would

- This was a very fun short project. I wish I had more time to refine some aspects of it. The technology stack is one that I really enjoy working with. I would love to tackle more tasks just like this one. Thank you for taking the time to review my work!
